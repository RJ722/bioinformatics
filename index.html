<p>In the early part of the last century, when David Hilbert was working on
stricter formalization of geometry than Euclid, Georg Cantor had worked out a
theory of different types of infinities, <i>the theory of sets</i>. This
theory would soon unveil a series of confusing paradoxes, leading to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_mathematics#Foundational_crisis">
a crisis in the Mathematics community </a> regarding the stability of the
foundational principles of the math of that time.</p>

<p>Central to these paradoxes was the <em>Russell’s paradox</em> (or more generally, as
we’d talk about later, the <em>Epimenides Paradox</em>). Let’s see what it is.</p>

          <div><p>It isn’t uncommon for software developers to encounter some code that they had
written in the past and reflecting on it - the most common reaction would
probably be “It must be the most horrible thing I wrote”. But sometimes, there’s
that aha moment where you find something and you are instantly gratified and
proud of yourself, “Oh, this is so beautiful, no wonder it took so many
sleepless nights”. However glamorous it may sound, but it is indeed a difficult
task to write and maintain such code, and this is where automatic tools come in
to the picture. Let’s discuss about one such tool - <a href="https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture">Vulture</a>, which
helps discover unused stuff in Python code.</p>

<p>Getting selected as a Google Summer of Code student with coala was a
breakthrough for me. The coala community touched me on every aspect of open
source software development, especially how to get along with peers (and troll
them :-p). And it has happened again - I am a student with coala one more time,
and I look forward to learn yet more from my dear mentors and the beloved coala
community.</p>
