<i> **TLDR**: I'm gonna be digitizing my notes from Andrew Ng's course -
[deeplearning.ai][dl] as a series of blog posts over the next few days. [ Stay
tuned! ][newsletter] :) </i>

## Background

{% newthought 'As' %} you might have noticed during the past few days, on the
recommendation of my mentor and a dear friend, [Jason Braganza][jason], I have
been trying to push beyond my boundaries and trying to get some rust off of this
blog.

I also thought that this was a nice opportunity to get myself out of my comfort
zone and write about different themes which I had always enjoyed reading but
never really dread to write about, things like politics and philosophy.

"There's an xkcd for everything" %}

Although I really enjoyed nearly every part of such writing: churning out
research material, looking for counter statements, understanding the argument as
a whole & putting it all together, etc., but I find that to put together a
rather convincing post, it takes up a lot of time and effort, something which my
upcoming schedule wouldn't allow.

Instead, I've come up with a new scheme. I am currently revising the first few
courses of the popular online specialization taught by Andrew Ng,
[deeplearning.ai][dl] and this blog serves as a great opportunity to digitize my
notes and making them publicly available.

And the selfish reason behind me doing this "noble task" is best [summarized by 
Andrew Trask][andrew], who is a DeepMind Researcher and a Ph.D. student at
Oxford University. He’s also the author of the amazing book: Grokking Deep
Learning. Here's what he says:

>  The secret to getting into the deep learning community is high quality
>  blogging. Read 5 different blog posts about the same subject and then try to
>  synthesize your own view. Don’t just write something ok, either — take 3 or 4
>  full days on a post and try to make it as short and simple (yet complete) as
>  possible. Re-write it multiple times. As you write and re-write and think
>  about the topic you’re trying to teach, you will come to understand it.
>  Furthermore, other people will come to understand it as well (and they’ll
>  understand that you understand it, which helps you get a job). Most folks
>  want someone to hold their hand through the process, but the best way to
>  learn is to write a blogpost that holds someone else’s hand, step by step
>  (with toy code examples!). Also, when you do code examples, don’t write some
>  big object-oriented mess. Fewer lines the better. Make it a script. Only use
>  numpy. Teach what each line does. Rinse and repeat. When you feel comfortable
>  enough you’ll then be able to do this with recently published papers — which
>  is when you really know you’re making progress!

Rachel Thomas, who is a Ph.D. in Math, a professor at USF Data Institute and is
very well known as the cofounder of [fast.ai][fastai], has the [ following to say
for blogs ][rachel]:

> It’s like a resume, only better. I know of a few people who have had blog
> posts lead to job offers!
>
> Helps you learn. Organizing knowledge always helps me synthesize my own ideas.
> One of the tests of whether you understand something is whether you can
> explain it to someone else. A blog post is a great way to do that.

Now, those are excellent reasons for me to start blogging already, but I've an
additional whip from our very own [Mr. J. Braganza][jason] looming over my head
waiting to crank down on me the moment I stop writing, so I rather prefer to
continue!

Thanks again [Jason][jason]!
