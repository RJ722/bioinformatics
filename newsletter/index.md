### My newsletter is named _'Et cetera'_

I send it out roughly once a month with updates on my work, etc. I am not very
(at all, actually) coherent with the content of the newsletter -- If I found an
interesting problem, sure, or a boring problem and an interesting solution, why
not! Oh, look I found a book on typography, it goes on my newsletter!

That said, I'm generally very aware about my reader's time and promise not to
spam you, ever! :-)

Now, enter your email address below and subscribe!
