      <h1>About</h1>
<p class="subtitle"></p>


<p>I am Rahul Jha (~ RJ722). I am currently studying Electronics Engineering at <a href="https://www.amu.ac.in/principal.jsp?did=10147">Zakir Husain College of
Engineering and Technology</a></p>

<p>I help maintain <a href="https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture">vulture</a>, a
tool for finding dead (~unused) Python code, and <a href="coala.io">coala</a>, a
language independent static code analysis tool.</p>

<p>I was a <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2017/projects/5154725527814144/">
Google Summer of Code student</a> with coala in 2017 and again in 2018, wherein
I worked on <a href="https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture"> Vulture </a> - which was a
great experience.</p>

<!-- I believe that pursuing open source is one of the best ways I can give back to
the society, passing on what I learned. -->

<!-- ### Reading

I like to learn new things and that is why I read, a lot about tech and yet more
about the open source movement. I also like to read about history, otherwise I
believe we're just going around in circles. I also like poetry and plan to start
reading fiction soon. -->

<!-- ### Meetups and Conferences

I've a lot of fun at conferences - whether I am an attendee or an organizer,
either way I get to meet and learn from like minded people. I also host regular
meetups through AMU-OSS, where anyone from the audience is welcome to come and
speak about whatever she's been working on lately.

I was invited as a speaker in PyCon India 2017 where I spoke about **"Reducing
Dead Code Ratio of Python Projects using vulture"**. In the same conference, I
also delivered a lightening talk on **"coala - What, Why and How?"** and met quite a
few celebrities in the Python community and made a lot of friends.

I also gave a similar talk, titled **"Scavenging Dead Code using Vulture"** at
DevConf, India 2018 and was also invited to DevConf, Czech but could not visit
due to logistics. -->

<h2 id="other-fun-facts-about-me">Other ‘fun’ facts about me</h2>

<p>I love tweaking themes and desktop environments until I make them ugly.</p>

<p>I can touch type with an average speed of around 80-85 WPM.</p>

<p>I like Urdu shayari.</p>
