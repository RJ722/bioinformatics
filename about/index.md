I am Rahul Jha (~ RJ722). I am currently studying Electronics Engineering at <a
href="https://www.amu.ac.in/principal.jsp?did=10147">Zakir Husain College of
Engineering and Technology</a>

I help maintain <a href="https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture">vulture</a>, a
tool for finding dead (~unused) Python code, and <a href="coala.io">coala</a>, a
language independent static code analysis tool.

I was a <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2017/projects/5154725527814144/">
Google Summer of Code student</a> with coala in 2017 and again in 2018, wherein
I worked on [ Vulture ](https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture) - which was a
great experience.

<!-- I believe that pursuing open source is one of the best ways I can give back to

<!-- ### Reading

I like to learn new things and that is why I read, a lot about tech and yet more
about the open source movement. I also like to read about history, otherwise I
believe we're just going around in circles. I also like poetry and plan to start
reading fiction soon. -->

<!-- ### Meetups and Conferences

I've a lot of fun at conferences - whether I am an attendee or an organizer,
either way I get to meet and learn from like minded people. I also host regular
meetups through AMU-OSS, where anyone from the audience is welcome to come and
speak about whatever she's been working on lately.

I was invited as a speaker in PyCon India 2017 where I spoke about **"Reducing
Dead Code Ratio of Python Projects using vulture"**. In the same conference, I
also delivered a lightening talk on **"coala - What, Why and How?"** and met quite a
few celebrities in the Python community and made a lot of friends.

I also gave a similar talk, titled **"Scavenging Dead Code using Vulture"** at
DevConf, India 2018 and was also invited to DevConf, Czech but could not visit
due to logistics. -->

## Other 'fun' facts about me

I love tweaking themes and desktop environments until I make them ugly.

I can touch type with an average speed of around 60-65 WPM.

I like Urdu shayari.
